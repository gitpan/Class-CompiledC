Class-CompiledC version 2.20
============================

Class::CompiledC let's you implement your Objects as C structs, 
with type checking accessor methods.


Version 2.20 is the first public release of this module, and you better treat
the version number as $VERSION -= 2.19. I have been using this code for long
time, it's has proven to be stable (for me, on a limited number of platforms, so
it is very likely that you will encounter things i never saw)

The code behind this module has constantly changed, it started as a class with
just an AUTOLOAD routine to provide autogenerated accessor methods for hashbased
objects, but that's along time and a half a million lines of deleted code ago.
Class::CompiledC has been tested with perls from 5.6 but was only recently
tested on 5.8.7 and 5.9.4, both on Windows (2003, Enterprise Server FYI).

I used it successfully with 
        Microft Visual C++ 7.0 (and it's NMAKE)
        MinGW (Version 3.2.0) (with a fairly old MS NMAKE)
        MinGW (Verison 3.4.5) (with dmake 4.5)
        
If you have any suggestions, bug reports, improvements, patches or comments
then drop me a mail at blade@focusline.de . 

If you however want to sell me Viagra, Penis Enlargements or want to make me
Business proposals, then i encourage you to use only uppercase letters to
improve readablity for me.
